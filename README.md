## üöÄ Introduction

COBOL remains a foundational language for business and financial systems, powering payroll, banking, and enterprise operations for decades. This project demonstrates a classic payroll processing application in COBOL, ideal for learning or portfolio use.

---

## üìå Project Purpose

This Payroll Processing System reads employee data, calculates gross pay, tax, and net pay, then outputs a summary report. It models real-world payroll logic and showcases key COBOL features used in business.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Input**:  
   Reads each employee's ID, name, hours worked, and hourly rate from `employee.dat`.

2. **Processing**:
   - Gross Pay = Hours √ó Rate
   - Tax:
     - 20% if Gross Pay > 100000.00  
     - 10% otherwise
   - Net Pay = Gross Pay ‚àí Tax

3. **Output**:  
   A readable payroll summary is written to `payroll.rep`.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
PayrollProject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PayrollProject.cbl   # Main COBOL source file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employee.dat         # Input file (fixed-width format)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payroll.rep          # Output file (generated after run)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Project documentation
```

## üß™ Sample Input (`employee.dat`)

Each line is exactly 35 characters with no delimiters.

| Employee ID | Name (20 chars, padded) | Hours Worked | Hourly Rate (e.g., 8000 = 80.00) |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| 00001       | John Smith             | 00400        | 08000                             |
| 00002       | Lisa White             | 00350        | 09500                             |
| 00003       | Marcus Jones           | 00451        | 10000                             |

**Example Lines:**
```
00001John Smith         004008000
00002Lisa White         003509500
00003Marcus Jones       004510000
```

## üì§ Sample Output (`payroll.rep`)

```
00001 John Smith Hrs: 00400 Rate: 08000 Gross: 320000.00 Tax: 32000.00 Net: 288000.00
00002 Lisa White Hrs: 00350 Rate: 09500 Gross: 332500.00 Tax: 33250.00 Net: 299250.00
00003 Marcus Jones Hrs: 00451 Rate: 10000 Gross: 451000.00 Tax: 45100.00 Net: 405900.00
```

## üèóÔ∏è Key Code Example

Below is the COBOL code snippet for tax calculation:
```cobol
IF GROSS-PAY > 100000
    COMPUTE TAX = GROSS-PAY * 0.20
ELSE
    COMPUTE TAX = GROSS-PAY * 0.10
END-IF
```

## üõ† How to Run

### üß∞ Requirements
- [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) or [OpenCobolIDE](https://open-cobol-ide.readthedocs.io/)
- Windows, Linux, or MacOS

### ‚öôÔ∏è Steps
1. Clone or download the project
2. Open in OpenCobolIDE or terminal
3. Make sure `employee.dat` is in the same folder as the `.exe` or `.cbl`
4. Compile with:
    ```bash
    cobc -x -free PayrollProject.cbl
    ```
5. Run:
    ```bash
    ./PayrollProject.exe  # Or run in IDE
    ```

## üß† Key Learning Points

- File I/O in COBOL (SELECT, FD)
- Fixed-format data handling
- Arithmetic with COMPUTE
- Using STRING for dynamic line building
- Structured PERFORM and IF blocks

---

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

- **employee.dat not found**: Ensure the file exists in the same directory as your compiled binary or source.
- **Compilation issues**: Make sure you are using GnuCOBOL with `-free` for free-format syntax.

---

## üì¶ Future Improvements

- Add overtime pay logic (e.g. 1.5√ó after 160 hours)
- Export to CSV format for Excel integration
- Console menu interface
- Total payroll summary (e.g. total gross/net)
